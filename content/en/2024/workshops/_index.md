<h2> <a name="NatLang"></a>Natural language interfaces powered by large language models</h2>

<p><h3>Abstract:</h3></p>

<p>
Natural language (NL) interfaces have been a topic of research for fifty years. In that time, much has been learned about user experience design for NL interfaces and about how people use language when interacting with NL interfaces. But translating natural language to a deterministic command or structured query that a machine can execute has remained an extremely challenging task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made that task much easier. As a result, NL features will become standard for many applications in the coming months and years. We are at the start of a new era of user experience design.</p>

<p>
In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn the fundamentals of NL interfaces. Topics will include: the history of NL interfaces, why LLMs now make it easier to implement NL interfaces, which application scenarios are a good fit for NL features, as well as ethics and accessibility considerations. Workshop participants will also gain experience building NL features using an NL interface prototyping web app.

<h2> <a name="AICloud"></a>Tutorial: Develop Explainable AI Services on Cloud Computing and Open Source Models</h2>

<p><h3>Abstract:</h3></p>

<p>The objective of this tutorial is to introduce systematic
methods with supplementary tools and computing models for
developing explainable AI. As AI increasingly penetrates various
application domains, practitioners need more comprehensive
approaches for model quality assessments and explainability.
This tutorial bridges the gap between theoretical XAI techniques
and their practical implementation in cloud services and opensource
models. We explore a range of XAI methodologies, from
model-agnostic to model-specific approaches, examining their
applicability across diverse AI models and deployment scenarios.
The tutorial introduces design principles for integrating XAI into
AI services and facilitating early adoption in MLOps lifecycles.
Through experimental evaluations and case studies on both cloud
AI services and open-source models, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of these approaches in real-world scenarios. We discuss
strategies for pipeline automation, provenance data management,
and optimizing the operational overhead of XAI integration.
Additionally, we explore the robustness of XAI methods under
adversarial conditions. This comprehensive exploration equips
participants with insights into XAI’s role in AI systems, practical
implementation skills, and critical perspectives on future research
directions, ultimately benefiting the development of explainable
and robust AI systems.

<h2> <a name="iM-PACT"></a>1st Workshop on Intelligent Modeling for Practical Applications and Community Transformation in Life Sciences (iM-PACT)</h2>

<p><h3>Abstract:</h3></p>

<p>Modeling is a vital part of the design thinking of complex systems and in studying and understanding complex phenomena. Its ability to abstract systems, while retaining domain-specific details, allows stakeholders to view the system from different perspectives. Models can serve as the effectively indistinguishable digital counterpart of actual real-world physical products, systems, and processes (sometimes referred to as twins) for practical purposes, such as simulation, integration, testing, monitoring, maintenance, and artifact generation.</p>

<p>In computer science and mathematics, modeling is standard practice across many domains, including but not limited to machine learning models, system models, and performance models. Besides, modeling plays an important role in various domains such as epidemiology, environmental studies, and biology. For example, epidemiological models during the COVID-19 pandemic played a crucial role in understanding the spread of the virus, evaluating the potential impact of interventions, and guiding public health decisions. However, it also became evident that tool support for domains other than computer science is not as developed or as accessible to non-CS experts. Challenges around usability, appropriateness, and representativeness pose obstacles to the adoption of tools traditionally used in software modeling by experts in other.</p>

<p>The objective of this workshop is twofold: first, to expose modeling experts to tooling and automated processes related to modeling, from design to code generation and to simulation, and second, to raise awareness for developers of modeling tools to listen to challenges of other domains and develop appropriate tools.

<h2>CyPress: 4th Workshop on Software Techniques for Cyber-Physical Systems</h2>

<p><h3>Abstract:</h3></p>

<p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) refer to systems comprising of software components, physical components and social entities which monitor, control, and coordinate processes within a physical environment. CPSs apply to a wide range of mission-critical applications that span from the intelligent management of logistics in complex supply chains, advanced manufacturing systems and smart contracts, all the way to autonomous systems, and systems that support the smart interactions between humans and machines (M2H), or between machines (M2M). In this respect, the engineering of CPSs goes beyond existing Software Engineering concepts, tools and techniques because of the very nature of CPSs that spans three realms (cyber, physical, social) and therefore need to address requirements that span these realms.</p>

<p>The workshop aims to bring together leading researchers, as well as experts from software and hardware companies and technology receptors to discuss and debate the latest developments in engineering Cyber-Physical Systems.
</p>

<h2> <a name="YTech"></a>YTech: CASCON STEM Outreach Workshop</a> (virtual Zoom event)</h2>

<p><h3>Abstract:</h3></p>

<p>Collectively, we face significant challenges to our well-being and overall future existence as a society — climate change, healthcare, liveable cities, transportation, finance — the list goes on. But there are solutions on the horizon, and this is going to take an “all-hands-on-deck” approach.</p>

<p>According to Statistics Canada, more than 140,000 Canadians graduated with a STEM degree in 2021. Furthermore, a survey by Randstad found that 65% of Canadians between the ages of 45 and 67 would focus on a career in STEM if they were 18 again.</p>

<p>STEM careers include much more than sitting in front of a computer. With science, we can develop materials that make the colour of our cars stay shiny. With math we can optimize the schedules of city buses. With industrial processes we can develop materials that make airplanes lighter so they consume less fuel.</p>

<p>This workshop aims to bring together in one virtual space students, professors, and admission officers so that Grade 9-12 students can get a glimpse of exciting STEM areas and consider these in their possible career paths.

<h2> <a name="DITA"></a>1st Workshop on Dependable Internet-of-Things Applications (DITA)</h2>

<p><h3>Abstract:</h3></p>

<p>As society and economy progressed through the information age to the age of “intelligent things” and cyber-physical systems, new challenges have risen. As digital systems become more interconnected with people and enter more aspects of daily life, their reliability becomes of paramount as it may not only disrupt economic activity, but also prove a security and safety hazard. Internet-of-Things, which is the umbrella term for all applications of interconnected intelligent digital devices, encompasses a number of technical aspects that span from software engineering and artificial intelligence to hardware-software co-design and data science. In 2018, a group of researchers across Canada put together the DITA NSERC CREATE (Collaborative Research and Training Experience) program. As a CREATE program, DITA aimed to provide unique training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students on IoT, software engineering, data science and cybersecurity, along with their applications on domains such as health, civil engineering, and urban development. As a primarily industrial program, DITA forged a number of collaborations with local companies, which gave our trainees a chance for more practical experience through internships. Six years later, the 1st DITA workshop at CASCON aims at taking a retrospective look at the achievements of the DITA CREATE program and of its graduates. In addition, it aims at providing an outlook for future research on IoT and cyber-physical systems. Alumni of the program and industrial collaborators will talk about their experience with the program and their views on the future of IoT research.

<h2> <a name="ML4DM"></a>ML4DM ‘24: The Fourth Workshop on the Emerging Applications of
Machine Learning in Modern Data Management</h2>

<p><h3>Abstract:</h3></p>

<p>Machine Learning (ML) has gained prominence across
various fields, including data management. Rule-based
components are being replaced by ML-driven counterparts that
extract rules from experience. Statistical methods are giving way
to approaches that learn functional dependencies, correlations, and
data skewness. Learning-based techniques offer advantages, such
as reducing the cost of developing and maintaining complex
classical modules while tailoring behavior to individual system
needs. This workshop brings together leaders from research
projects and audiences from academia and industry to explore
examples of utilizing ML to modernize data management. The
discussed instances span five categories: Robust Plan Selection,
Database Knobs Tuning, Data Acquisition, Join Order Selection,
and Query Plan Representation.

<h2> <a name="SENGEC"></a>1st Workshop on Software Engineering Economics</h2>

<p><h3>Abstract:</h3></p>

<p>With the transition of economy towards the fourth and fifth industrial revolutions, software has acquired an even more important role in the economy. From a business enabler and an economic driver, software has become the actual product. Many traditional sectors, like banking or manufacturing, have transformed from mere software users to software producers and providers. In this sense, software carries increasing economic and business value for various critical businesses and sectors. Unlike traditional products and services, software does not follow the normal product cycle (production-usage-decay) in the same way. Through continuous evolution, software has the ability to be updated and upgraded without necessarily decaying or being replaced. One challenge in looking at the economic aspect of software is the inability to translate its technical properties into business or financial values at the various development phases of the software product. It is not always only about production cost, but also about operational reliability, perceived quality, marketability, profitability, and maintainability of the software. The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts from the different relevant disciplines (economics, business and marketing, and software engineering) and discuss the challenges and strategies of creating sustainable and successful software products. Through invited talks and expert panels, the audience of the workshop will have the opportunity to explore how to transform an idea for a software application to marketable product, what the challenges are around a sustainable and profitable software product and how to model the economics of software from its technical parameters.
