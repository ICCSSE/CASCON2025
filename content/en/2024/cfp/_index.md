CASCON is a premier academic and industrial conference for advanced studies in computer science and software engineering. Since 1991, CASCON has attracted software developers, researchers, innovators, technologists and decision-makers from academia, industry, and government, who come together to learn about technology trends, present papers, participate in workshops, and exhibit prototypes and solutions.

The conference program features thought-provoking keynotes, original research papers, stimulating workshops, and an engaging technology expo. Conference proceedings will be published in the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp">IEEE Xplore</a>.

During the conference, the papers can be accessed <a href="https://uottawa-my.sharepoint.com/personal/pshirani_uottawa_ca/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpshirani%5Fuottawa%5Fca%2FDocuments%2FCASCON%202024%20Proceedings&ga=1">in this link</a>.

We are happy to announce that this year CASCON will be co-located with CSCAN-INFOCAN, aiming to promote knowledge sharing, networking, and innovation in Canadian computer science and related fields.

Artifact Evaluation
{.h1}

Authors of papers accepted for CASCON 2024 have the opportunity to submit an artifact for evaluation. 

<a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=B2M3RCm0rUKMJSjNSW9HckBlcuSOR0VImR3x_esDUE1UMU4yMEVOVVhZRkJaSzJTNkpaMzA1UjczWC4u">Link to Submit Artifacts for Evaluation</a>

The artifact evaluation will attempt to reproduce experiments and determine if the results support claims made in the paper. We will follow the definition of an artifact published by ACM: "By “artifact” we mean a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results."

The artifact submission must include detailed instructions to allow an evaluator to determine if the artifact is functional and to reproduce the experiments.

Paper Types
{.h1}



CASCON 2024 calls for two types of research papers:

<ul>
  <li><b>Regular Papers</b> - Novel and mature research work, papers at most 10 pages long (including references).</li>
  <li><b>Short Papers</b> - Work in progress with some validation results, experience reports, new ideas and visionary papers based on supporting theory or evidence, and application papers at most 6 pages long (including references).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each technical paper must conform at the time of submission to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Formatting Instructions</a> (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTEX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf option). The submission must also comply with the <a href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/">IEEE Policy on Authorship</a>. 
</p>

CASCON 2024 will not accept submissions that have been previously published, are in press, or have been submitted elsewhere. We encourage interdisciplinary research papers. Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published in IEEE XPLORE.

One of the authors of the accepted papers must register and present the paper at the conference. Failure to attend and present the paper at the conference will result in withdrawal of the paper from the IEEE XPLORE proceedings.

Initial Manuscript Submission Instructions
{.h1}

Submissions are made via EasyChair and must be in the double column standard IEEE format for conference proceedings. All types of papers should strictly follow the page limit constraint to be considered as eligible for review. The defined page limit should include the paper, figures, tables, and references. The steps for submitting a paper are as follows: 

<ul>
  <li>Visit EasyChair at <a href=https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cascon2024>https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cascon2024</a>.</li>
  <li>After logging in, click on make a new submission to submit your paper.</li>
  <li>All authors should use the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Formatting Instructions</a>, which can be obtained from the IEEE Proceedings Template pages. 
<!--
Latex users should use the "sigconf" option, as well as the "review" (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers).</li>
-->
</ul>


CASCON 2024 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Therefore, submissions may not reveal the identity of its authors. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular:
<ul>
  <li>Authors' names must be omitted from the submission.</li>
  <li>All references to the author's prior work should be in the third person.</li>
  <li>While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to CASCON.</li>
  <li>During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title.
</li>
</ul>
