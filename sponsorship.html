    <p><strong>About CASCON</strong></p>
    <p>The IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Advances in Software and COmputiNg (CASCON) is a premier academic and industrial conference for advanced studies in computer science and software engineering.

The conference program features thought-provoking keynotes, original research papers, stimulating workshops, and an engaging technology expo.
